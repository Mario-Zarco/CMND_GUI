# CMND_GUI


I collaborated on the development of a GUI for visualizing, interacting with, processing, and analyzing hand and gaze data from reach-tracking experiments in virtual reality.

If you are interested in learning more about this project, please contact the CMND Lab at the University of Auckland.

This repository contains early versions of the classes for visualizing and interacting with hand data.

The video demonstrates some of the functionalities.
