# CMND_GUI


I collaborated in the development of a GUI to visualize, interact, process, and analyze hand and gaze data from reach-tracking experiments in virtual reality.

If you are interested in knowing more about this project, please contact the CMND Lab of the University of Auckland.

This repository contains early versions of the classes to visualize and interact with hand data. 

The video shows some of the functionalities.
